# Figma Design Implementation Request

## Current Navigation Bar Analysis

### What We Have Now:
- Location: `resources/js/Pages/Components/AdminNavbar.svelte`
- Styling: KTUI framework with custom CSS
- Current effects: Gradient backgrounds, shadows, hover animations

### What I Need From Figma:

Please provide **ONE** of the following:

---

## Option 1: CSS Code (FASTEST âš¡)

1. In Figma, right-click the navbar element
2. Select "Copy CSS" or "Copy styles"
3. Paste the CSS here

Example output you should get:
```css
.navbar {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, #256b6b 0%, #0c3c3c 100%);
  padding: 12px 24px;
  ...
}
```

## Option 2: Screenshot

1. Take a screenshot of the navbar
2. Upload it here or describe it

---

## Option 3: Visual Description

Please describe:
- **Colors**: What background color/gradient?
- **Spacing**: Padding, gaps between items?
- **Typography**: Font sizes, weights?
- **Hover effects**: Any animations or state changes?
- **Layout**: Centered? Full width? Container width?

## Option 4: Figma Dev Mode Specs

If you have Figma Dev Mode enabled:
1. Select the navbar frame
2. Go to the "Inspect" panel (right side)
3. Copy the CSS Properties
4. Share here

## What I'll Do Once I Have the Info:

âœ… Extract colors and gradients
âœ… Match spacing and padding
âœ… Implement hover effects exactly as designed
âœ… Apply typography and sizing
âœ… Update both AdminNavbar.svelte and CompanyNavbar.svelte
âœ… Add to main.css for consistency
âœ… Test and ensure it works perfectly
